Notes:
-Media queries can help css act responsively to different screen sizes
-Using the grid to think big picture layout
    -spanning certain elements across multiple rows or columns of the grid
    -"start / end" properties of the grid
-Theme switching
-CSS custom properties
-Horizontal scrollbar bug: padding added after viewport
    -auto will fix that problem due to padding being calculated after
     the viewport width or height have been set
-Centering flexbox rows and/or columns
-Learning differences between justify/align-content vs ""-self or ""-items etc.
